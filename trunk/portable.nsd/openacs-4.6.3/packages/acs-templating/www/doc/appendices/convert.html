  <h3>Templating System</h3>
  <p>Converting to the Templating System from DPS</p>
  <hr>

<p>Because the tag handlers are defined differently, the new templating system 
is not compatible with the Dynamic Publishing System.</p>

<h3>Installing the Templating System on the same server as DPS</h3>

<p>It is possible to install the templating system on the same server
as DPS.  However, you will have to comment out all <tt>register_adptag</tt>
statements in the Tcl library files associated with DPS.</p>

<h3>Converting Specification files to Tcl scripts</h3>

<p>The templating system distribution will include procedures for 
converting DPS specification files (<tt>.data</tt> and <tt>.form</tt> files)
to Tcl scripts.</p>

<h3>Converting ADP Templates</h3>

<p>The templating system distribution will include a script for 
converting ADP templates with DPS tags.  The main difference is
the use of <tt>@...@</tt> for variable substitution rather than
<tt>var</tt> tags; <tt>multiple</tt> and <tt>if</tt> tags retain
the same syntax.</p>
